## Meetup Overview

These meetups are intended to provide an opportunity to learn about Bitcoin from individuals who have been studying it for many years and who transact with Bitcoin (BTC) on a daily basis, both locally and globally. The goal of this group is to foster greater adoption in Nottingham among merchants to attract Bitcoiners and their bitcoin to Nottingham and encourage the development of circular economies within the region.

Please note that this meetup is not meant to provide financial or investment advice. It is for informational and entertainment purposes only. No purchase is necessary, and we will not ask for any personal data unless you make an enquiry and request that we get back to you after the event. Always conduct your own research to verify any information you receive from us, as we might be mistaken or operating under incorrect assumptions ourselves!

So please enjoy learning about this transformational technology through the presented content. We will break in an hour and after the break we'll have a bit more content and then workshop setting up Bitcoin Lightning wallet and exploring its basic features, namely receiving your first ever bitcoin, paying a lightning invoice of a specific amount, and just sending unspecified amounts to a wallet addresses or a custom Bitcoin Lightning Instant Payment Address (a blipa?!)

## Introductions

A super quick introduction for networking opportunities, chance to show off your favourite Bitcoin thing, and to see which areas of bitcoin the room needs to hear about again!

**Handle and Tribe**

As this is a meetup rather than a presentation let's have a quick once round the room to give everyone the opportunity to introduce themselves. As we have to think about personal security quite carefully in Bitcoin let's share only these 2 pieces of data (optional, just say pass if you don't want to)
- 1. What is your Name or Handle?
- 2. What team or region are you representing? (What part of a city, country or community do you consider yourself to be one of?)

I'll start, I am [NAME] and I'm from West Bridgford and Keyworth

**What bitcoin thing did you bring?(or what do you want to learn or talk about)**

Now everyone has spoken(or not) let's delve a little deeper, once round the room again to show off your bitcoin merch or thing and discover knowledge gaps and education requirements
- 1. What is your Name or Handle?
- 2. What awesome Bitcoin merch are you showing off and does it have a story behind it?
- 3. What is puzzling you or fascinating you with Bitcoin at the moment?

**First Timers / Newbies Intro**

Cover the basics in 15 mins with "The Bitcoin Story" (help us write and improve on this story so it can live in open source for all to use): 

Satoshi Nakamoto, Whitepaper 31st October 2008, open source software peer to peer decentralized monetary network, Genesis block 3rd January 2009 featuring The Times newspaper Headline "Chanceller on the Bring of Second Bank Bailout". 

21 million maximum supply, a bitcoin Miner (or most likely a pool of miners) will create a new block of transactions on average every 10 minutes, the block rewards they receive (a decreasing subsidy currently 6.25 BTC) are how new bitcoins are minted, a difficulty adjustment of the hash rate every two weeks keeps the chain in time. 

Every 4 years there is a halving of the subsidy until it is zero around the year 2140 and transaction fees become the miners sole income. 

Fast forward through the block size wars, china bans and huge gains in value and huge crashes, to today and the Bitcoin Lightning layer which lets you send the tiniest fractions of bitcoin "sats" from anyone's device to anyone elese's device at the speed of email for just a tiny % fee. 

First time users of a Lightning Wallet app can get n,000 sats to experiement with and share with others, from our sponsor this evening.

**Bitcoin Technical Explainer**
What 3 things about the way the bitcoin protocol works could we expand on this meetup?

i.e
- Energy Consumption - What percentage of Bitcoin mining electricity is reportedly from renewable or stranded energy?
- Difficulty Adjustment - What is the current number of zeros in the difficulty adjustment (13 Apr 2023 - 19 zeros?)
- Bitcoin Code Review - https://github.com/bitcoin (Who are the code guardians, who ultimately is responsible for approving new commits, will all commits get applied by all the nodes?


## Workshopping Bitcoin Lighting (First timers)

- Share the @payment address
	Learning: Sometimes your only opportunity to transmit the payment address is verbal, so you can use {hairysweater43@loungeofsatoshi.com} or a very cool personalised {sats@yourshopname.com} bitcoin Lightning instant payment address (a blipa!)
