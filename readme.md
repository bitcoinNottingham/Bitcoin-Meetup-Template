# Bitcoin Meetup Template

**You will need:**
- A private room or space away from other noise where you know you can control the environment (light, sounds, heat etc)

- Mics and sounds system(optional)

**Roles(could all be done by 1 person if a small meetup):**

## Pre Event Setup
- Place signage near the entrance of the venue so first timers are confident they're in the right place

- Make sure any food is ordered and timing agreed
- Venue check to ensure room is as required and toilets are OK
- What is the best table/seating layout for a Bitcoin Meetup?
- Pop something dynamic on the screen like https://bits.monospace.live/ or https://www.bitlisten.com/ 
	
## Meet and Greet

## Overview of Meetup
These meetups provide an opportunity to learn about Bitcoin from individuals who have been studying it for many years and transact with Bitcoin (BTC) on a daily basis, both locally and globally. The goal of this group is to foster greater adoption in Nottingham among merchants and encourage the development of circular economies.
