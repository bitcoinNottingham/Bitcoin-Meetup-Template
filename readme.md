# Bitcoin Meetup Template

**You will need:**
- A private room or space away from other noise where you know you can control the environment (light, sounds, heat etc)
- Presentation display(optional)
- Mics and sounds system(optional)

**Roles(could all be done by 1 person if a small meetup):**

## Pre Event Setup
- Place signage near the entrance of the venue so first timers are confident they're in the right place
- Have feedback forms to give on arrival with qr codes and links to discussion groups and Meetups Group Twitter handle
- Make sure any food is ordered and timing agreed
- Venue check to ensure room is as required and toilets are OK
- What is the best table/seating layout for a Bitcoin Meetup?
	
## Meet and Greet
Welcome all attendees as they enter the private space. It is a good idea to have something to give people something they can hold and look at as soon as they come through the door and direct them to "get a drink at the bar" and "have a seat anywhere you like"
